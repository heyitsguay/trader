- Next: Add trading stuff to `World`
  - When at a farmer, ask to buy or sell
    - Buy: List farmer's goods' names, quantities, prices.
    - Sell: List player's goods' names, quantities, prices.
    - Either way, type a number and a good. Calculate if the
      transaction can be done, execute if so.
    - Return to the same screen. Player can switch from buy/sell to
      the opposite or return to the host location.
- I think that's everything for the basic mechanics??
