x Next: Add trading stuff to `World`
  x When at a farmer, ask to buy or sell
    x Buy: List farmer's goods' names, quantities, prices.
    x Sell: List player's goods' names, quantities, prices.
    x Either way, type a number and a good. Calculate if the
      transaction can be done, execute if so.
    x Return to the same screen. Player can switch from buy/sell to
      the opposite or return to the host location.
x I think that's everything for the basic mechanics??
