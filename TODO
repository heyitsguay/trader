- Add brief farmer-player interaction summaries that farmers save to use for introductions.
x Fix buy con evaluation to actually use the con histories.
x Add sale con evaluation
x Figure out how to use a spinner properly within the buy and sell negotiations.
x Make LLM interactions more robust to failure
x Basic LLM integration is up, now parsing deal evaluation needs to be added.
  x When a deal if proffered, the player should be asked if they accept. Only end
    the interaction when both the player and farmer accept.
  x If a con happened, summarize what the con was and add it to the con history.
x Next: Add trading stuff to `World`
  x When at a farmer, ask to buy or sell
    x Buy: List farmer's goods' names, quantities, prices.
    x Sell: List player's goods' names, quantities, prices.
    x Either way, type a number and a good. Calculate if the
      transaction can be done, execute if so.
    x Return to the same screen. Player can switch from buy/sell to
      the opposite or return to the host location.
x I think that's everything for the basic mechanics??
